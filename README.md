#  Graphical user interface (GUI) Container on Docker

## Task Description ðŸ“„
This task involves launching a container on Docker in GUI mode and running GUI software within the container. Specifically, I will demonstrate running applications like Firefox and Jupyter Notebook inside a Docker container.

## Architecture Diagram

Below is an architecture diagram illustrating the setup:

## Prerequisites
- Red Hat (RHEL8) Linux
- Docker installed on the OS

## Steps to Achieve the Task

### Step 1: Check if Docker is Installed
First, verify that Docker is installed on your system by running:
```
docker info
```

### Step 2: Pull the Docker Image
Pull the CentOS Docker image:
```
docker pull centos:latest
```

### Step 3: Run the Docker Container
Run the CentOS container:

```
docker run -it centos
yum install firefox -y
```
This confirms that the Docker container is running successfully.

After the installation of firefox. Now run the firefox
![FireFox Error](error.png)
You can clearly see that it gives an error saying â€œno display environment variable specifiedâ€œ. So , So we require some display environment to run GUI applications. So we need to define $DISPLAY while launching container which i've done it in step 5.
### Step 4: Install GUI Applications in the Container
After running the container, install GUI applications like Firefox and Jupyter Notebook using the following commands:
```
yum install firefox -y
yum install python3 -y
pip3 install jupyter
```

### Step 5: Set Up Display Environment for GUI Applications
Running GUI applications directly in the container will result in an error due to the lack of a display environment. To resolve this, define the \$DISPLAY variable while launching the container:
```
docker run -it --name docker_vamsi --net=host --env="DISPLAY" --volume="$HOME/.Xauthority:/root/.Xauthority:rw" centos:latest
```
This command shares the host's XServer with the container by creating a volume and uses the host system's network for connectivity.

### Step 6: Launch Firefox
Run Firefox in the container:
```
firefox
```
Firefox should successfully launch. Ignore any non-critical installation package errors. Close the browser using \`CTRL+C\`.

### Step 7: Launch Jupyter Notebook
Install and launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
yum install python3 -y
pip3 install jupyter
jupyter notebook --allow-root
```

Congratulations! You have successfully launched Jupyter Notebook and Firefox in a Docker container. Similarly, you can run other GUI applications on top of the Docker container.
